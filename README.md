# el-fueradoro

This project contains a remotely controlled ignition system for audio-fireworks based on ATmega328P and RFM69CW.
Further information (in German) is given in [the user manual](../../tree/master/manual/fueradoro.pdf).

What the system is capable of doing can be seen in our [new year's fireworks 2015](https://vimeo.com/116115628) and [new year's fireworks 2016](https://vimeo.com/150594996).
