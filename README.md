# el-fueradoro

This project contains a remotely controlled ignition system for audio-fireworks based on ATmega328P and RFM69CW.
Further information (in German) is given in [the user manual](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fixxl/el-fueradoro@master/Manual/fueradoro.pdf).

What the system is capable of doing can be seen in our [new year's fireworks 2015](https://vimeo.com/116115628), [new year's fireworks 2016](https://vimeo.com/150594996), [new year's fireworks 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc5oZRx3s50), and [new year's fireworks 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unH9tJSg1mw).
